## Hello, I am Kyle Moses, and this is my GitHub

Before I started my degree plan, I knew a decent amount of code, but not how to professionally format and write it. I was not great with commenting code or using functions correctly. The plan of this portfolio is to show my knowledge, and skill when it comes to code. 
I learned how to work with others on a common goal by using GitHub in general, and leaving behind comments for when people noticed the work, they would know what was done. Communication was key in these team collaborating environments and making sure everyone was on the same page was something I took pride in. Which leads into communication with the stakeholders or owners of the products. I learned how to have effective communication with people from all backgrounds, and clearly explaining the current situation and processes taking place. Speaking in a clear and calm manner was key. Learning how to effectively communicate has, and will continue to help me be a benefit for teams to have but also help me to communicate with people not involved in the actual coding process.

I never really worked on data structures, and truthfully never really knew the meaning behind an algorithm before this. However, through the course I really started to excel at creating different algorithms, and making a comprehendible data structure that also is open for scalability. Throughout coding, I learned that creating code to fit a specific situation will only lead to more work in the end. Allowing my code to be built upon was key to my success, and will continue to be key to success when moving forward in my professional career. 

Databases and software engineering were definitely not my specialty, but I learned how to make a functioning database that really allowed for more applications to be built upon them. My personal career and motives are around security, and I take happiness in knowing that my work is secure. I looked back in my old code from multiple different things, and it was easy to see that security was not my goal then, and seeing my growth from those times was humbling. 

Throughout this page, there are two separate artifacts demonstrating my abilities and skills over the ranges of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and databases. 
The first artifact is a computer graphics and design class, where I created a 3D scene, and improved upon it by adding a function to make it run smoother and become easier to read. 
The algorithms and data structures along with databases used the same artifact that interacts with a database, to create a web application allowing for easier viewing, searching, and visualizations for the database. 

The link to my code review for these artifacts is held [here](https://youtu.be/YXB7MF9owdE)
From here, I will be adding in the original code, labeled as such, and the code that has been changed a revamped.
